Hi, welcome to the course! In this video, you 'll be learning about the reason we use INSTEAD OF triggers   to modify data with DML statements and what happens if we don't use them.

## INSERT statement for views

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "f3c3ec2950"
```

`@part1`
| Id | StuName | City      | MajorId |
|----|---------|-----------|---------|
| 1  | Elina   | Toronto   | 3       |
| 2  | Daniel  | Kitchener | 1       |
| 3  | Julia   | Vancouver | 4       |
| 4  | Ryan    | Toronto   | 2       |
| 5  | Emily   | Manitoba  | 1       |

`@script`
Assume we have two tables one named 'Student' is the records of the student names, their city and their major id.The second table named 'Major' holding the Major id  and major names. 
Now, I want to create a view from these two tables  which includes the Student names and their city from Student table and Major Names from the Major table.

## Let's Practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"

Now, it's time to do some actual coding to learn the INSTEAD OF triggers better.
